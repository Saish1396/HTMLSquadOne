		<h1>This is Heading Main</h1>
		<p lang="en-us"> Seems like this is a paragraph. Short one, that's for sure. That thing in the front that I put there with the "en-us"? That's an attribute. 
			Although I do wonder what happens when I go to a new line.</p>
			
		<h2>Obviously the two signifies that this is a subheading.</h2>
		<p>I wonder if pressing enter here makes a difference in the spacing on the webpage
            like
            so (hint, no it doesn't- it's called white space-- and it's great for indenting code to make it easier to follow).</p>
	    
		<h2>I'm bored of subheadings</h2>
		<p> Paragraphs are <b>alright</b><i>, i guess</i>. </p>
