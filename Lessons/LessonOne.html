		<h1>This is Heading Main</h1>
		<p lang="en-us"> Seems like this is a paragraph. Short one, that's for sure. That thing in the front that I put there with the "en-us"? That's an attribute. 
			Although I do wonder what happens when I go to a new line.</p>
			
		<h2>Obviously the two signifies that this is a subheading.</h2>
		<p>I wonder if pressing enter here makes a difference in the spacing on the webpage
            like
            so (hint, no it doesn't- it's called white space-- and it's great for indenting code to make it easier to follow).</p>
	    
		<h2>I'm bored of subheadings</h2>
		<p> Paragraphs are <b>alright</b><i>, i guess</i>. In this sentence, I'm using <b>bolded text</b> as well as <i>italicized text.</i>          However, <em>personally,</em> I <strong>prefer</strong> using the "strong" and "em" tags, because they're clearer about their intent. <br /> Sometimes, I want a line break to demonstrate a break in my thought (without having to create a new "p"-tagged paragraph.) Other times <hr /> a horizontal rule, as shown above, can be more divisive and really does split the paragraphs nicely. Other things that might be necessary for you to use is superscript, whenever you want to show that 3<sup>3</sup> = 9, or subscript, when you want to tell people that ozone, O<sub>3</sub> is a tropospheric pollutant, a respiratory irritant, and damages plant skin, despite its benefits in the stratosphere. As you can see by now, HTML really isn't all too difficult to pick up, and it's pretty intuitive.</p>
