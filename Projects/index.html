		<h1>Siddhesh Dabholkar hello -- Professional Man with a Plan</h1>
			<p> What is my passion? <br /> Humanity is my passion. I've always wanted to take a step back, examine the state of our human psyche.
			From there, to understand and find ways to solve <em> problems </em>. From there, I've started and led many projects.
			</p> <hr /> 
			
			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><p><strong>Yiblr Alarm App</strong> <br /> I started the idea of this alarm clock back in late 2014. I absolutely hated having to swipe to turn off
				an alarm and having to face the challenge of a bright screen against your tearing eyes, day after day. So, in Winter 2015, I collaborated with Peter
				Soboyejo and Haris Jagannathan to create <q>the alarm clock that listens.</q>
				<br/> It uses the: <ol>
				<li><strong>Voice detection software</strong> in your device to respond to your <i>morning shouting.</i></li>
				<li><strong>Gyroscope</strong> in your device to respond to shifts in your device, such as flipping your device over</li>
				<li><strong>Proximity Sensor</strong> in your device to respond to hand waves or swipes over your device</li>
				</ol><br />
				This app will be available on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store?hl=en">Google Play Store</a> soon, and for more information, check out our
				<a href="https://www.facebook.com/yiblr?ref=br_tf">Yiblr Facebook Page</a>.
				
				</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>Middle<sup>Men</sub></strong> <br /> Brennan Casey and I have started a business that deals mainly in products that can be sold on eBay.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong><acronym title="Youth and Government">YAG</acronym></strong></p></li>
