			<p> What is my passion? <br /> Humanity is my passion. I've always wanted to take a step back, examine the state of our human psyche.
			From there, to understand and find ways to solve <em> problems </em>. From there, I've started and led many projects. Interested, or               have more questions? <a href="mailto:saish.dabholkar@gmail.com">Email me.</a>

			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p><strong>Yiblr Alarm App</strong> <br />
                I started the idea of this alarm clock back in late 2014. I absolutely hated having to swipe to turn off an alarm and having to                   face the challenge of a bright screen against your tearing eyes, day after day. So, in Winter 2015 (at CodeDay NJ), I collaborated                 with Peter Soboyejo and Haris Jagannathan to create <q>the alarm clock that listens.</q>
				<br /> It uses the: <ol>
				<li><strong>Voice detection software</strong> in your device to respond to your <i>morning shouting.</i></li>
				<li><strong>Gyroscope</strong> in your device to respond to shifts in your device, such as flipping your device over</li>
				<li><strong>Proximity Sensor</strong> in your device to respond to hand waves or swipes over your device</li>
				</ol><br />
				This app will be available on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store?hl=en">Google Play Store</a> soon, and for more                             information, check out our

				<li><p><strong><abbr title="New Jersey Youth and Government">NJ YAG</abbr></strong> <br /> Youth and Government. <em>My second                     home</em>. This is where I persevered-- in the Courts-- and learned to be myself and shine. I am the <strong>Chief Justice of                     Court A</strong> in this program.
