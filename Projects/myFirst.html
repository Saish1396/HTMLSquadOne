		<h1>This is Heading Main</h1>
		<p> Seems like this is a paragraph. Short one that's for sure.
			Although I do wonder what happens when I go to a new line.</p>
			
		<h2>Obviously the two signifies that this is a subheading.</h2>
		<p>I wonder if pressing enter here makes a difference in the spacing on the webpage
            like
            so (hint, no it doesn't).</p>
	    
		<h2>I'm bored of subheadings</h2>
		<p> Paragraphs are alright.</p>
